I have this message: dumpe2fs -h /dev/sdb2

The dumpe2fs -h /dev/sdb2 command is used to display superblock and filesystem information for an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem on a specific partition (in this case, /dev/sdb2). The -h option limits the output to the superblock information, which includes details like the filesystem size, block size, mount count, and last mount time. This command is useful for diagnosing filesystem issues or understanding filesystem characteristics.

Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

dumpe2fs: The command to dump ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem information.
-h: Displays only the superblock information (without it, you'd get a lot more data).
/dev/sdb2: Specifies the partition you want to examine.
This can be helpful if you’re troubleshooting, checking filesystem health, or getting metadata on your filesystem setup.

sorry, this: sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/old
mount: /mnt/old: can't read superblock on /dev/sdc1.
       dmesg(1) may have more information after failed mount system call.

The error message indicates that the mount operation on /dev/sdc1 is failing because it can't read the superblock, which is crucial for mounting the filesystem. This typically suggests filesystem corruption or issues with the superblock. Here’s how you can troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

1. Check dmesg for Detailed Error Messages
Run the following command to view recent kernel messages that might provide more insight:

bash
Copy code
dmesg | tail
Look for any specific errors related to /dev/sdc1 that might clarify the nature of the issue.

2. Try Mounting with an Alternative Superblock
Filesystems usually have backup superblocks. If the primary superblock is corrupted, you can try mounting with a backup superblock. First, find the available backup superblocks:

bash
Copy code

(base) [apohorai@pohaserver ~]$ sudo ddrescue -f -n /dev/sdc1 /hdd/backuphdc1.img /hdd/backuphdc1.log
GNU ddrescue 1.28

It looks like ddrescue is working and making progress, albeit slowly, with some read errors along the way. Here’s what the output tells us and what you might consider next:

Progress: ddrescue has rescued about 22 GB of data so far (4.43% of the total). It’s encountering a few read errors (31 so far), which suggests that some parts of the disk are damaged, but it’s effectively working around those errors.

Non-trimmed and Non-tried Areas: ddrescue still has a significant portion of the drive left to attempt (non-tried: 477802 MB). It should continue trying to recover as much as possible, but the process may take several hours.

Bad Areas and Read Errors: The absence of bad areas so far and a manageable read error count indicate that many of the issues may be localized. ddrescue will skip over these as it encounters them and continue rescuing the accessible data.

Next Steps:

Let ddrescue Run: Since ddrescue is still in its first pass, allow it to continue. The initial run is focused on recovering as much data as possible, while later passes can attempt to re-read bad sectors if necessary.

Consider Running ddrescue in Scraping Mode: Once the initial pass is complete, you could use scraping mode to recover data from difficult-to-read areas. To do this, run:

bash
Copy code
sudo ddrescue -d -r3 /dev/sdc1 /hdd/backuphdc1.img /hdd/backuphdc1.log
Here, -r3 attempts to re-read bad areas up to three times. Adjust this number if needed, but be aware that higher retry counts may stress the drive.

Monitor for Errors: Keep an eye on the read error count and bad sectors. If the errors increase significantly, this may indicate worsening disk health, in which case you should consider stopping the recovery to avoid further damage.

Verify and Repair Recovered Data: Once ddrescue completes, you can check the recovered image for filesystem integrity with fsck (if it’s an ext filesystem) or use recovery software to browse the image for specific files if needed.

Let it run and see if it manages to recover a substantial portion of your data. Let me know if any new issues arise or if you'd like advice on handling the recovered image.



sudo dumpe2fs /dev/sdc1 | grep -i superblock
This command will list the locations of the backup superblocks.

Then, try mounting with one of these backups:

bash
Copy code
sudo mount -o sb=BACKUP_SUPERBLOCK /dev/sdc1 /mnt/old
Replace BACKUP_SUPERBLOCK with one of the superblock locations provided by dumpe2fs.

3. Run Filesystem Check (fsck)
You can also try repairing the filesystem using fsck. Ensure the partition is unmounted before doing this:

bash
Copy code
sudo fsck -f /dev/sdc1
This command will attempt to repair any issues in the filesystem. After running fsck, try mounting the partition again.

4. Check Partition Type
If the partition isn’t ext2/ext3/ext4, dumpe2fs won’t work. Check the partition type with:

bash
Copy code
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc
If it's a different type, such as NTFS or FAT, you’ll need the appropriate tools (e.g., ntfsfix for NTFS).

5. Backup Data (If Critical)
If the data is critical, consider creating an image of the partition first, as any repair operations might risk further damage:

bash
Copy code
sudo dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=/path/to/backup.img
Let me know if you encounter any specific error messages from dmesg or fsck that need further interpretation.

sudo dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=/hdd/backuphdc1.img

The Input/output error during the dd operation indicates that there may be physical issues with the disk or partition. Despite this, you managed to copy about 1.2 GB before the error occurred. Here are some steps to help you proceed with the backup or data recovery:

1. Use ddrescue for a Robust Backup
ddrescue is designed for data recovery and works better than dd when there are disk errors. It will skip over bad sectors and continue reading the rest of the data. Here’s how to use it:

Install ddrescue if it’s not already installed:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install gddrescue
Run ddrescue:

bash
Copy code
sudo ddrescue -f -n /dev/sdc1 /hdd/backuphdc1.img /hdd/backuphdc1.log
The log file (/hdd/backuphdc1.log) will keep track of the sectors that ddrescue couldn’t recover, allowing you to retry later if needed.

2. Run fsck to Attempt Repair
Since there’s an input/output error, you may want to attempt repairing the filesystem before trying to copy data again. Ensure the partition is unmounted and run:

bash
Copy code
sudo fsck -y /dev/sdc1
The -y option will automatically answer "yes" to prompts, allowing fsck to attempt repairs without interruption.

3. Check Disk Health with smartctl
If you suspect hardware issues, it’s worth running a SMART test on the disk to understand its health:

Install the smartmontools package if needed:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install smartmontools
Run a quick SMART check:

bash
Copy code
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdc
Look for any warnings about reallocated sectors, pending sectors, or other errors indicating disk failure.

4. Consider Professional Data Recovery (If Critical)
If the data is critical and these attempts don’t succeed, it may be time to consult a professional data recovery service, as physical disk issues are often beyond typical repair tools.

Let me know how it goes with ddrescue or if any specific errors appear in the fsck or smartctl output.
